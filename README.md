#### Introduction
Airbnb company (Air Bed and Breakfast) is an American marketplace for lodging founded in 2008 and covered wide places around the world. Besides the services, Airbnb provides protection for guests and hosts. There is some criticism of the company due to the potential for increasing home rents and disturbing neighbors who live near rental properties.

#### Project Motivations
The questions that were highlighted during investigating and analyzing the Airbnb dataset for Seattle, WA are:
- Does the host respond to the guest on time for the booking?
- Does host response time affect the average price?
- Is the host a super host?
- What are the favorite neighborhoods by guests in Seattle?
- Do neighborhood locations affect the average price?
- What type of property is most demanded by the guest?
- Does the property type affect the average price?
- What type of room is most demanded by the guest?
- Does the room type affect the average price?
- What are the cancellation policy types in Seattle?
- Does the cancellation policy type affect the average price?
- What is the average price trend throughout the year (2016)?
- Does the availability of properties affect the peak season period?

#### Work Environment
We performed our project in the open-source Anaconda Distribution using Python 3, and we have used the following libraries:
